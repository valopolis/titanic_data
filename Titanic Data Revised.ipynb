So it was not surprising to see that most of the survivors came from Southampton since that is where the majority of the passengers were from anyway.  What was surprising to me was that the amount of 3rd class passengers who survived is only slightly less than the total first class surviving passengers, and much more than the 2nd class passengers.  Of course given the fact that there were a higher number of 3rd class passengers to begin with this would not be surprising except that it counters the notion that 3rd class passengers were not given a fair chance to survive because of their lower status.\n",
